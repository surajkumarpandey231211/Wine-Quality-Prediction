# Wine-Quality-Prediction

This repository contains a Python script for predicting the quality of wine using linear regression. The script uses the scikit-learn library to perform linear regression on a dataset of wine characteristics, aiming to predict the quality of the wine based on various input features.

Getting Started
To use this script and perform wine quality prediction, follow the steps below:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the Dataset:
Place your wine dataset file (CSV format) containing relevant features and quality scores in the data directory.

Run the Script:
Run the linear regression script, providing the path to your dataset file as an argument:

bash
Copy code
python predict_wine_quality.py --dataset data/wine_data.csv
Dataset
The dataset should be in CSV format with the following columns:

fixed acidity: Non-volatile acidity of the wine.
volatile acidity: Volatile acidity of the wine.
citric acid: Citric acid content in the wine.
residual sugar: Residual sugar content.
chlorides: Chloride content in the wine.
free sulfur dioxide: Free sulfur dioxide content.
total sulfur dioxide: Total sulfur dioxide content.
density: Density of the wine.
pH: pH level of the wine.
sulphates: Sulfate content in the wine.
alcohol: Alcohol content.
quality: Quality score (target variable).
Ensure that your dataset is preprocessed and formatted correctly before running the script.

Results
After running the script, you will see the predicted wine quality scores based on the linear regression model. The script will also provide information about the model's performance, including metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Model Customization
You can customize the script by modifying parameters like train-test split ratio, model hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics. Feel free to experiment with different settings to improve the model's accuracy.
